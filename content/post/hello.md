I will use [medium](https://medium.com) as my publication platform and i will create a script for reading the publications and generate posts here.

What was used and will use on this site is:

- [hugo](http://gohugo.io) for generate statics
- [hugo-nuo](https://github.com/laozhu/hugo-nuo) for theme
- [python](https://www.python.org/) for scripts
